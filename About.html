				I was born and raised in northern New Jersey, close to the Pennsylvania border, and lived there until 2016 when I moved down here to sunny Philadelphia. My biggest passions are soccer, snowboarding and travelling, which I try to enjoy as often as I can. Through college I was lucky to travel quite a bit, visting exciting places such as Germany, Austria, the Philippines and El Salvador. Each winter I enjoy going on ski trips with my two best friends from childhood, which we hope to continue this winter with a trip to Japan.  </p>

				I went to college at the University of Scranton in northeastern Pennsylvania. You may recognize the city of Scranton from the hit TV show The Office. While at Scranton I studied International Business with a focus on Asian Studies. I wanted to combine my love of travel & cultures with my studies with the hope that I would be able to travel the world for work.</p>

				Since graduating college in 2013, I have been working at advertising agencies at home in New Jersey and here in Philadelphia. I worked as a project manager and an account executive, working to manage projects through the agency and ensuring they meet the client's standards. After 5 years I have realized that this career path does not quite suit my skills or interests, so I have decided to return to school to learn web development with the hope of returning to agency life upon completing this course. </p>

				I am a very active and outdoorsy person, who would prefer to be outside than inside. I love to travel and explore new places. I also love to play and watch soccer as often as I can. I tend to wake up early every weekend to watch the English Premier League and support my favorite team, Arsenal! </p>
